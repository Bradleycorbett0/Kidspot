      <h2>What is KIDSPOT?</h2>
      <p>KIDSPOT is the UK's first open, free-to-use platform that helps families and youth workers find nearby activities for children aged 10–16 — instantly. Whether it’s football in a church hall, coding classes at a library, or creative arts in a youth club, KIDSPOT maps and filters it all in one place.</p>

      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Millions of families don’t know what’s available locally.</li>
        <li>Youth workers struggle to keep up with scattered event info.</li>
        <li>Young people miss out — not due to money, but missing information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Built by Lived Experience</h3>
   <p>This platform was born from real struggle — homelessness, poverty, and frontline youth work. It’s not built for clicks — it’s built to connect.</p>
